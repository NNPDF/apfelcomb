* Finishing scripts for FK tables

These scripts follow the format <SETNAME>_genFK.sh
and are used at the end of APFELComb FK table generation to
convert the APFELComb output to the final format.

Typically this involves a FKmerge call to combine separate
tables, and sometimes the creation of a COMPOUND file.

Each file is automatically copied to the appropriate table
directory by APFELComb and renamed to genFK.sh.

Note that it is no longer a requirement to add a genFK script
purely for the purposes of checking the grid output. This
is now done automatically.
